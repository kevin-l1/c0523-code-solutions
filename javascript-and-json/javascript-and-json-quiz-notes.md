## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is JSON?
JSON is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax that can be used independently from JavaScript. JSON exists as a string and needs to be converted to a native JavaScript object when you want to access the data. You can include the same basic data types inside JSON as you can in a standard JavaScript object â€” strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, and other object literals. This allows you to construct a data hierarchy.

- What are serialization and deserialization?
Serialization is the process of turning an object in memory into a stream of bytes so you can do stuff like store it on disk or send it over the network.
Deserialization is the reverse process: turning a stream of bytes into an object in memory.

- Why are serialization and deserialization useful?
They all you to easily store or transport objects between different systems.

- How do you serialize a data structure into a JSON string using JavaScript?
JSON.stringify()

- How do you deserialize a JSON string into a data structure using JavaScript?
JSON.parse()
