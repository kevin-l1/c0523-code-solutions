  You can store values in variables

  Assign the equal operator (=) to the variable

- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  Letters and numbers and the symbols "$" and "\_". First character can not be a digit

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  It means that to use the variable, it must be typed the exact same way as it was when it was declared. Capitalizations matter

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
  "null" means that there is a nonexistant or invalid object or address while "undefined" means that there is currently nothing in the variable that has been declared.

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
