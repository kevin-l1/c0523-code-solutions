## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a computer process?
  A process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads.

- Roughly how many computer processes are running on your host operating system (Task Manager or Activity Monitor)?
  211

- Why should a full stack Web developer know that computer processes exist?
  Because full stack Web development is based on making multiple processes work together to form one application, having at least a cursory awareness of computer processes is necessary. This will be extremely important when learning about applications made of multiple components, such as clients, servers, and databases.
