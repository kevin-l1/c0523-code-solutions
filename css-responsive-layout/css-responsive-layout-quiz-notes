## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
The points at which a media query is introduced

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
If you use a fixed width, the width will always be static and doesn't take into account different device screen sizes.

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
Because of how line priority works. If you create a new rule below a previous rule for the same element, it overrides the previous rule.
