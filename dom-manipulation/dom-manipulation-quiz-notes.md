## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the `className` property of element objects?
It returns the object's class name

- How do you update the CSS class attribute of an element using JavaScript?
By assigning a string value to the object with the property getClass.

- What is the `textContent` property of element objects?
The text content of the node and its descendants.

- How do you update the text within an element using JavaScript?
By assigning a string value to the object with the property textContent.

- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?
No, the event parameter isn't always necessarily used.

- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?
More complicated, as you would probably need to type more code to create something else to keep track of the clicks like a function if you can't use a variable.

- Why is storing information about a program in variables better than only storing it in the DOM?
Storing it in the DOM isn't as good because the DOM is static and will not automatically update.
