## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- In JavaScript, when is scope determined?
  There is a lexical scope that works by checking if it can find a variable in its local execution context. If it doesn't, it will look for it in its calling context. And if not found there in its calling context. Repeatedly, until it is looking in the global execution context. (And if it does not find it there, itâ€™s undefined).

  JavaScript's lexical scoping property

- What values does a closure contain?

  All functions are created with a closure
