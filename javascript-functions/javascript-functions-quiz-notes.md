## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  Functions allow you to package up code for use later in your program.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  function keyword, an optional name, a comma-separated list of zero or more parameters, surrounded by (), the start of the function's code block, as indicated by an {, an optional return statement, and the end of the function's code block, as indicated by a }.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  The function's name and a comma-separated list of zero or more arguments surrounded by () parentheses.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  When calling a function, you don't type "function" and there is no need to type the function's code block again.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter acts as a placeholder. Parameters are declared and when we call a function, we pass it arguments.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  They act as a placeholder for the arguments that will be passed when calling the function.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  It causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program and prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.
